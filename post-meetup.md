# Coding for everyone - after the Meetup

Once the meetup is over, we reccomend you to carry on coding!

Join our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone), you can ask help if you ever get stuck, or help someone else!

Please fill out the feedback form in [English](https://goo.gl/forms/5AcnjIkuH9FBQj862) or [Italian](https://goo.gl/forms/gncZOvVdLgKueIqI3). You are very helpful to improve what we are doing!
