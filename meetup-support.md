# Coding for everyone - Meetup support

Notes to help Meetup participants.

## First Meetup?

What's your programming level?

### No previous coding experience

- Register on [Github](https://github.com/)
- Register on [FreeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) (using Github)
  - Start Front End Dev path up to the end of "Basic algorithm scripting", skipping the projects
  
You might be interested also in the book [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) available online for free.

### I already know a bit of JavaScript

- Register on [Github](https://github.com/)
- Register on [Codewars](http://codewars.com/) (using Github)
  - Complete some kata in JavaScript
  - Create some kata

If instead you want to program on your computer, you can try [Exercism](http://exercism.io). It's a bit more realistic as you need to code outside of your browser, but it's a bit slower to ramp up.
